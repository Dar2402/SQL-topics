  - Creating and querying views
  - Updating data through views
  
- **Indexes**
  - What are indexes and why are they important for performance?
  - Creating, modifying, and dropping indexes
  - Types of indexes (e.g., B-Tree, Hash Indexes)

---

### **10. Transactions**
- **What is a Transaction?**
  - ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
  - Using `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`
  
- **Isolation Levels**
